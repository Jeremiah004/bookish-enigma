Place generated card artwork files in this directory when deploying:

- apple-card-1.png
- apple-card-2.png
- xbox-card-1.png
- xbox-card-2.png

In this Cursor workspace, these images are available under the assets paths
created by the AI assistant; when running the app outside of Cursor, copy the
corresponding PNG files into this folder so that the product image URLs in
`lib/products.json` resolve correctly.
